#Contributing Guide

There are several ways you can contribute to the development of the book. These include:

- File an issue whenever you come across a mistake in the text.
- File a Pull Request if its something minor, like a typo or a reference addition.
- In general, I wont accept complete chapters or topics without discussion. This is subject to debate and discussion, so file an issue before trying something like this.
- File an issue if you find a topic missing.

I will usually be the final authority on what goes into the book. If you are filing a PR, make sure that the markdown is valid. Don't worry about building the book for now.

As a final note, you can also contribute by donating via ]Gratipay](https://gratipay.com/josd/).

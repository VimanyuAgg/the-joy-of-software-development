# About the author

I'm Abhay Rana, popularly known as Nemo. I've been making software ever since I was a kid. Over time, I've turned into a Hacker News addict and that is my primary credential for writing this book.

My primary motivation for writing this book is getting all of this knowledge out of my head, and out there in the world, so people can benefit from it. It is licensed under a Creative Commons license, so you are free to share it ahead. and do what you want.

I am a graduate in Engineering from IIT Roorkee, and a founding member of SDSLabs.

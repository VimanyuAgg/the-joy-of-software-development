#Introduction

**DISCLAIMER**: If you are just getting started with programming, do not read this book. This is not a book for beginner programmers. This is a book for intermediate and beginner software developers. This will not teach you how to program in a particular language, but deal with the lots of intricacies of making real software.

Software Development is the craft of making good software. As a software developer, the easiest way to become better at your craft is to re-invent it. Our industry is highly volatile, and the next big thing is always round the corner. This includes various tools and technologies that we, as developers, use to make software.

Good software developers are specialists in their own fields. But the best developers are versatile, who can switch between languages, frameworks and tools. Good software is all about making the right decisions, and to make those decisions, you need to have an understanding of multiple fields.

Lets take an example. Say, you were working on a bit-torrent client. Here is a small list of things that you'd need to learn/understand in order to take a stab at the problem:

- The bittorrent Protocol
- The underlying TCP and UDP protocols
- A graphical widget framework for the GUI, preferably one that works across platforms
- A programming language
- Threads and processes to allow non-blocking downloads
- A build tool such as Make or ant
- A dependency manager, such as gem or npm
- Assuming you aren't just making it for yourself, you'll be using a version control system such as git

Oh you don't do cross platform development, I hear you say. As a web developer, I'm right there with you. However, the traditional web stack has grown larger over time:

- HTML/CSS/JS are primary requirements these days
- A backend framework such as Rails, Sails.JS or Laravel
- Dependency management tool such as gem, npm, or composer
- A build tool - rake, grunt, gulp
- A test framework - phpunit, mocha, karma, jasmine
- A CSS compiler - SASS, LESS
- A database (with an ORM probably) - mySQL, postgres, ActiveRecord
- Responsive design, because you want it to look good on mobiles
- A CSS framework perhaps, such as bootstrap or pure
- A deployment tool, such as FTP, Capistrano along with hosting services like Heroku and Nodejitsu

Yes, you don't _necessarily_ have to learn all of these things. You could probably pick and choose a stack and then specialize in it. But, if there is one thing that sticks in our industry: _it is change_.

What you are using today might not even be relevant 5 years from now. Unless you are fine being a COBOL developer (who arguably are among the highest paid) working on legacy systems 10 years down the line, you need to become acquainted with these things.

Yes, you won't become a specialist in all of these things. And thats fine. The end goal here is not to become awesome at everything. It is to stay awesome at a few things, and _be aware_ of many other things.

As I'm primarily a web developer, I am not exactly unbiased in choosing the contents of this book. However, I'm aware of this bias and will actively fight against it and try my very best in making this book helpful to _all software developers_.

As a final note, this book will not only be covering tools, but also techniques such as Test Driven Development, Agile, Iterative Development as well.

**DISCLAIMER about Windows**: While this book will discuss a few windows related concepts, the majority of the code and examples in this book were written with a Unix-ish setup in mind. Many of the concepts will make no sense to a Windows-only developer, so proceed with caution.
